# Automatic pixelation effect on face and body
A little project I made after seeing the effect in Watch Dogs. You need a photo of your face so the effect only applies to you.

°You need to save your photo in the "reference_photos" folder.
°Then install the libraries.
°Run dca.py (if you have multiple cameras, you can change this on line 26 of the code).

The effect can be disabled with the "P" key.
You can close the program with the "Q" key.
